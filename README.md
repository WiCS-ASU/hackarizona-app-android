# Hack Arizona
The largest Hackathon in the Southwest! 
Hack AZ participants can now navigate all of the events much easier by way of:
  * Having the schedule at the palm of their hands
  * Access to maps of the venue to better navigate where sponsor tables are
  * Push Notifications when each event starts
  * Much more!
